# Getting Started

## Download

Reqable recommends downloading the [Latest Version](https://reqable.com/zh-CN/download/). If you have other considerations, you can also download the [Historical Version](https://github.com/reqable/reqable-app/releases).

## Installation

### Windows

On Windows, you download `Setup.exe` and just follow the setup installation program instructions. There is currently no installation-free version available, mainly because Reqable installation requires writing the registry (associated with `har` and other file formats).

### Mac

On Mac, Reqable provides installation packages for both Apple chip and Intel chip. If you download the DMG file, open it and drag app into the `Applications` folder; if you are using `Homebrew`, please try this command:
```shell
brew install reqable
```

### Linux

The Linux version requires the GTK library. Please confirm whether the system has GTK installed before installation. The Linux installation program is a deb file. We currently only provide the x64 architecture version. You can install it using `apt`:
```shell
sudo apt install reqable-app-linux-x86_64.deb
```
