# License

Reqable provides a free community version. Almost all features are free, but the number of usage is limited, such as the number of API collections, the number of API tabs. But a good product needs financial support, for the long-term and sustainable development of the product. We hope everyone can support the professional and enterprise subscriptions to help us make a better software.

There are two types of licenses: Professional and Enterprise. The professional edition is suitable for personal teams or independent developers. The enterprise edition is suitable for multiple people or large-scale teams to purchase. The professional version is more expensive, but the number of devices that can be used at the same time is more, see [Pricing](https://reqable .com/pricing).

The subscription period of the license can be yearly or monthly. We recommend annual subscription more, you can enjoy technical consulting services, and the price is more favorable.
